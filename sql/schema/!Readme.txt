This "schema" folder contnains .sql files, for each table, respetively.
In order to generate the schema, it contains a "seed.schema.sql" file to run all scripts in the folder.

Notes:
- Any changes for any table could be done in current table .sql file. If you want to change a table - just modify the file, run the script, and it's done. Advanced cases require a migration .sql file, but thats beyond this note.
